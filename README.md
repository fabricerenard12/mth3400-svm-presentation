# SVMs in Functional Analysis (MTH3400)

## Overview

This repository contains materials for a presentation on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in the context of MTH3400 - Functional Analysis for Engineers. SVMs are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. In this presentation, we explore the fundamentals of SVMs and their application in engineering contexts.

## Contents

- **Code**: Contains C++ implementation of SVM from scratch with different kernel functions.
- **Data**: Contains sample datasets used for training and testing SVM models.
- **Presentation Slides**: PowerPoint or PDF slides used for the presentation.
- **Report**: Summary report on the theoretical aspects and practical implementation of SVMs.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (if running the code)
- LaTeX distribution (if compiling report using LaTeX)
- PowerPoint or PDF viewer (for presentation slides)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mth3400-svm-presentation.git
```

2. Navigate to the appropriate directory:

```
cd mth3400-svm-presentation
```

3. Explore the code, data, presentation slides, and report.
